# Introduction
   The blink program uses the LED (light-emitting diode) built into Maker Board to flash on and off.Blinking a LED with a delay. Atmega32 is a very popular high performance 8 bit AVR Microcontroller.There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. Using relays, transistors, orcomponents like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller.

# Objective
   The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
   
# Features
   It has simple features.
       
    1.It can switch off the LED's when switch is in off state.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
    
    # 4W's and 1 H's
   ## Why
    1.To blink two LED's using a switch using ATmega328.
    
   ## When
    1.In schools and colleges it can be implemented in mini projects.
    
   ## Where
    1.LED blinking circuit can be used as vehicle indicator.
    
   ## Who
    1.It can be used by all who knows the basics of embedded.
    
   ## How
    1.By loading the program in ATmega328.
    2..By using softwares
    
   # SWOT Analysis
    
   ## Strengths
    1.Cost effective.
    2.simplw
    
   ## Weakness
    1.Basic program.
    
   ## Opportunities
    1.By adding more components we can make the Program more complex.
