# Introduction
   The blink program uses the LED (light-emitting diode) built into Maker Board to flash on and off.Blinking a LED with a delay. Atmega32 is a very popular high performance 8 bit AVR Microcontroller.There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. Using relays, transistors, orcomponents like an inverter, a 555 Timer or a microcontroller.

# Objective
   The main objective is to blink the led using ATmega328 and a switch to controll two LED's.
# Features
   It has simple features.
       
    1.It can switch off the LED's when switch is in off state.
    2.It can switch on the LED's when switch is in on state.
